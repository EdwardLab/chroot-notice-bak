Unhappy SSH Bash: Required key not available

Hi guys,

When I connect to my Nethunter through SSH from my laptop, (tried both root and kali as user). It seems the SSH bash environment is limited.

with most commands I type in, the SSH terminal returns:

-Bash: /usr/bin/TheCommandIJustTyped Required key not available

I looked everywhere online, not much help available. Can anyone help? Am I the only one with this problem?

Is it to do with the Magisk Rooting process or the SSH Key generation from the server?

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

I have the same issue.

Xiaomi Mi 9T - MIUI 11 - Android Ten - nethunter 2020.2

```

blue@John:~$ ssh root@192.168.1.10

root@192.168.1.10's password:

-bash: /etc/profile: Required key not available

-bash: /root/.bash_profile: Required key not available

-bash-5.0# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),27(sudo),3003(sockets),3004(inet)

-bash-5.0# pwd

/root

-bash-5.0# ls

-bash: /usr/bin/ls: Required key not available

```

This seems to be the issue of the chroot and ssh's pam.

I once used the Chromebook with Crouton Linux Chroot. When drop into chroot shell, the Downloads folder of Chromebook cannot be written to: same error: "Required key not available".

They have a solution of comment out a line in /etc/pam.d/su-l

```

# session optional pam_keyinit.so force revoke

```

Though this solution hasn't been working for me.

While waiting for someone with a fix, I have a work around of ssh into android shell and chroot into kali.

Install openssh via termux

```

apt install openssh

sshd

```

SSH into android user at port 8022. Set up ssh key if wanted.

```

ssh u0_a205@192.168.1.10 -p8022

su root

bootkali

```

Not very secure and conveniently. Though it works.

Hi blueorchid, thanks for the suggestions! I've tried both your methods, the first one didn't really have any effect, the 2nd one, I think only works if you've installed NH from Termux. I installed NH chroot manager and magisk, Termux doesn't seem to be able to reach the Kali installation even as root.

Found a solution:

editing the /edc/pam.d/ AND /etc/pam.d/su- files to comment out this line:

# session optional pam_keyinit.so force revoke

It worked for me, but no idea why. Maybe someone can illuminate us :-)

 

blueorchid said:

Yeah the fix works for me too. I commented out the line "session optional pam_keyinit.so force revoke" in all the files under "/etc/pam.d/":

/etc/pam.d/su-l

/etc/pam.d/login

/etc/pam.d/runuser-l

/etc/pam.d/ssh

That error is caused by an encrypted data partition. Magisk cannot handle user context changes on encrypted data partitions.

Please flash an encryption disabler for your phone and format data.

Reboot and verify in "settings" that your phone is not encrypted.

How do i even connect to my nethunter phone through ssh.

When i try to connect it asks me for a password.

I tried root:toor but nothing works.

Hi all,

I've had same problem on a Xiaomi with LineageOS 17.1, in a LinuxDeploy Debian Buster chroot

As re4son said, the problem starts once i encrypted Android data partition.

Thanks to your comments, I've been able to solve the problem commenting the line:

#session optional pam_keyinit.so force revoke

in /etc/pam.d/sshd and /etc.pam.d/su-l files.

After restart chroot environment, write operations from chroot to Android encrypted data partition is working.

Thanks to all.

Same Problem on Android 12, tome-linux(https://github.com/2moe/tmoe-linux) chroot to Archlinux ARM.

#session optional pam_keyinit.so force

revoke

comment this line finally works for me, but this line doesn't exist directly in `/etc/pam.d/sshd` in Archlinux ARM.
